Prey Remains 
This repository contains photographs of Prey remains, predominantely pluckings but some legs and skulls, from Sparrohawk kills in Edinburgh. Each photo represents the species that were found in each sample bag, and does not represent all feathers from each species but rather the key feathers which led to the identification of a species.
